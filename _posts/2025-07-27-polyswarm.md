> Built on Ethereum and Polygon, Polyswarm is a decentralized threat intelligence marketplace that protects users and enterprises by leveraging a global network of security experts. It replaces slow, centralized antivirus models with a competitive system that rewards accuracy and speed.

## What is Polyswarm?

[Polyswarm](https://polyswarm.io) is a decentralized marketplace where security experts and their AI engines compete to analyze potential threats. Instead of relying on a single vendor, Polyswarm aggregates intelligence from thousands of micro-engines to deliver faster, more accurate verdicts on malicious files and URLs.

It’s built on blockchain principles, using economic incentives to foster a collaborative and highly effective security ecosystem.

Key features:
- 🔬 **Threat Marketplace**: Submit suspicious artifacts and receive rapid analysis from a global network of experts.
- 💰 **Economic Incentives**: Experts stake tokens to guarantee their accuracy, earning rewards for correct analysis and losing their stake for incorrect assertions.
-  crowdsource **Crowdsourced Intelligence**: Users can install a browser extension to passively contribute security data and earn rewards.

> With Polyswarm, you get access to a diverse and dynamic threat intelligence feed that traditional, siloed security models can't match.

## The Origins of Polyswarm

Polyswarm was developed by **Narf Industries, LLC**, a cybersecurity firm with extensive experience building security systems for government agencies like **DARPA**. The founders recognized a critical flaw in the traditional cybersecurity model: it was too slow, reactive, and centralized to keep up with the rapid evolution of malware.

The idea emerged to solve the growing problem of delayed threat detection and the blind spots inherent in any single security vendor's approach.

Instead of another incremental improvement, Polyswarm reimagined threat intelligence with:
- **A decentralized marketplace** for open competition
- **"Proof of Accuracy" staking** to ensure expert accountability
- **Crowdsourced telemetry** for a real-time view of emerging threats

Today, the ecosystem is evolving towards a decentralized governance model driven by holders of its native token, $NCT.

## How Polyswarm Works

### 1. You Submit an Artifact
A consumer (like an enterprise SOC team) submits a suspicious artifact (a file or URL) and places a bounty in $NCT tokens. The artifact is stored on IPFS.

### 2. Experts Compete to Analyze It
A global network of independent security **Experts** (also called "engines") stakes $NCT to make an **Assertion** on whether the artifact is malicious or benign.

### 3. Settlement via Ground Truth
The system determines the "ground truth." Engines that were correct are rewarded from the bounty and the forfeited stakes of incorrect engines. This entire process creates a powerful economic incentive for speed and accuracy.

> This competitive approach means threats are analyzed by a diverse set of specialized engines, dramatically reducing the chance of a single point of failure.

## Unique Features of Polyswarm

| Feature | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **Threat Marketplace** | An open, real-time market where anyone can submit artifacts for analysis by competing experts. |
| **Proof of Accuracy** | Experts must stake $NCT tokens as a confidence bond, which is forfeited if their analysis is wrong. |
| **PolyScore™** | An actionable 0-100 confidence score that quantifies the maliciousness of an artifact based on expert consensus. |
| **Crowdsourced Intelligence** | A browser extension allows passive data collection from users, who are rewarded for helping map emerging threats. |

## Why Choose Polyswarm Over Traditional Antivirus?

Most antivirus (AV) solutions are centralized. They rely on their own internal research team to identify threats and push updates, a process that can be slow and creates vendor lock-in.

**Polyswarm goes further:**
- 🔬 **Aggregates verdicts** from thousands of engines, not just one.
- 💰 **Incentivizes accuracy** with a public, economic-driven model.
- ⏱️ **Reduces detection time** by fostering real-time competition.
- ⛓️ **Offers transparent results** on a decentralized, censorship-resistant platform.

> Polyswarm gives you the best of all worlds: diversity of analysis, economic incentives, and verifiable results.

## The Role of Ethereum & Polygon

Polyswarm is a Web3 project built on core blockchain infrastructure:
- ⛓️ Uses **Ethereum** for its security and settlement layer.
- ⚡ Integrates with **Polygon** as a Layer 2 scaling solution to enable fast, low-cost transactions for bounties and assertions.
- 🪙 The **$NCT token** is an ERC-20 utility token that fuels the entire marketplace economy.

This hybrid approach allows Polyswarm to leverage Ethereum's robust security while maintaining the high throughput needed for a real-time intelligence platform.

## Industry Impact: A New Standard for Collaboration

Since its launch, Polyswarm has:
- Created the first **open and competitive marketplace** for threat intelligence.
- Pioneered the use of **cryptoeconomic incentives** to validate security analysis.
- Onboarded a diverse network of both established security firms and independent researchers.

It’s widely used by:
- 🏢 Enterprises and MSSPs needing to augment their security stack.
- 🕵️ Incident response teams requiring rapid verdicts on unknown files.
- 👨‍💻 Security researchers looking to monetize their detection engines.

By shifting from a closed, siloed model to an open, collaborative one, Polyswarm has changed what users expect from threat intelligence solutions.

## How to Use Polyswarm (as a User)

The easiest way to contribute and get rewarded is with the browser extension.

1.  Go to the [Polyswarm homepage](https://polyswarm.io) and find the extension link.
2.  Install the extension for your browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
3.  Let it run in the background. It passively and privately collects threat telemetry.
4.  Done — you will be rewarded in $NCT for your contribution to the network.

> Threat data collection is privacy-preserving and automatic. No extra setup is required.
