> Forget pay-to-win. CryptoRoyale is a free-to-play, skill-based battle royale where your reflexes, not your wallet, determine your success. This guide will take you from a curious newcomer to a seasoned warrior, ready to claim your ROY tokens.

## What is CryptoRoyale?

[CryptoRoyale.one](https://cryptoroyale.one) is a browser-based, free-to-play crypto game that's incredibly easy to start but difficult to master. Players control colored orbs in a constantly shrinking arena, fighting to be the last one standing. It's a fast-paced game of wits and agility.

The core philosophy of the game is simple:

-   🧠 **Purely Skill-Based:** There are no NFTs to buy or characters to level up with money. Your ability to dodge, aim, and strategize is the only thing that matters.
-   💰 **Play-to-Earn (P2E):** You earn the game's native cryptocurrency, ROY, for winning matches. It's a true P2E model where you are rewarded for your time and skill.
-   🌐 **Multi-Chain:** The game's token, ROY, exists on multiple blockchains, including Avalanche and Polygon, making it accessible to a wide audience.

## The Gameplay: How to Play and Win

The game has evolved from its simple beginnings. The core is now a fast-paced shooter with a rock-paper-scissors combat mechanic.

### The Basics
1.  **Join a Game:** Visit the website and click "Quick Play" to instantly join a match.
2.  **Movement:** Your orb follows your mouse cursor.
3.  **Shooting:** **Left-click** to fire a projectile in the direction of your cursor.
4.  **Boost:** **Right-click** to get a short burst of speed to dodge or close in on an opponent.
5.  **Health:** You have a health bar and a shield. Your shield regenerates over time, but your health does not.

### The Color Triangle: Rock-Paper-Scissors Combat
This is the most important mechanic to understand. Your orb and your projectiles have a color, and colors have advantages over others.

-   🩷 **Pink** beats 💛 **Yellow**
-   💛 **Yellow** beats 💙 **Blue**
-   💙 **Blue** beats 🩷 **Pink**

If your projectile hits an opponent with a color you are strong against, you do extra damage. If you hit an opponent with the same color or a color you are weak against, you do less damage.

You can change your color by picking up colored boxes that spawn randomly on the map.

> Mastering combat means constantly changing your color to counter your nearest opponent. Don't stay one color for too long!

## The ROY Token: Understanding the Economy

**ROY** is the heart of the game's economy. It's not just a reward; it has real utility.

| Feature       | Details                                                              |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Use Case** | In-game rewards, staking for passive income, and future governance.      |
| **Chains** | Avalanche (AVAX), Polygon (MATIC), Harmony (ONE).                    |
| **How to Get**| Win games, finish high in tournaments, stake ROY, or buy it on a DEX.         |
| **Tokenomics**| ROY has a fixed supply and is deflationary. The prize pool is funded by buybacks from staking fees, ensuring a sustainable economy. |

> The game's economic model is designed to be sustainable. It doesn't rely on a constant influx of new players to pay the old ones.

## Game Modes & Features

CryptoRoyale offers several ways to play and earn:

-   **Ranked:** The standard game mode where you play against others to climb the leaderboard and earn ROY based on your placement.
-   **Tournaments:** Scheduled events with larger prize pools. These are highly competitive and are a great way to earn a lot of ROY if you are skilled.
-   **Custom Games:** Create private lobbies to play with friends or practice against bots. This is the best way to learn the game without pressure.

### Skin Wars: The Daily Clan Battle
Skin Wars is a unique, daily competition that adds a social and strategic layer to the game. It's not just about individual skill, but about clan loyalty.

**How it works:**
1.  **Join a Clan:** In the game, you can equip a skin. Each skin belongs to a "clan" (e.g., the Cat Clan, the Robot Clan, the Abstract Clan). By equipping a skin, you are representing that clan for the day.
2.  **Compete Daily:** As you play in Ranked mode, your performance contributes to your clan's total score.
3.  **Winning Clan:** At the end of the day, the clan with the highest collective score wins.
4.  **Shared Prize Pool:** All players who participated in the winning clan for that day receive a share of a daily ROY prize pool.

This system encourages players to collect different skins and coordinate with others, adding a fun meta-game on top of the core gameplay. It also creates a "Create-to-Earn" opportunity for artists, whose submitted skins can become the foundation for new clans.

## Strategy Guide: From Beginner to Pro

### Beginner Tips
-   **Practice in Custom Games:** Before jumping into Ranked, play against bots to get a feel for aiming, boosting, and the speed of the game.
-   **Focus on Positioning:** Always be aware of the shrinking circle. Use your boost to get to a safe position, not just to attack.
-   **Learn the Color Triangle:** Your top priority is to always try to have a color advantage over the players nearest to you.

### Intermediate Strategy
-   **Leading Your Shots:** Players are always moving. Don't aim where they are; aim where they are *going to be*.
-   **Shield Management:** Your shield is your most valuable resource. If it breaks, retreat and let it recharge before you engage in another fight.
-   **Third-Partying:** Let two other players fight each other. While they are weak and distracted, you can move in to clean up and get easy eliminations.

### Advanced Tactics
-   **Boost Juking:** Use your boost unpredictably to dodge incoming shots. A quick boost left or right can make you a very difficult target to hit.
-   **Map Control:** Learn where the color boxes spawn. Controlling these areas means you control the flow of the game, as you can deny your opponents the colors they need.

> Winning consistently is about making smart decisions under pressure, not just having the best aim.
